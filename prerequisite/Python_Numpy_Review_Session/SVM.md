## SVM

Support Vector Machine is a powerful supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks.

### Core Concept

The fundamental idea of SVM is to find an optimal hyperplane in the feature space that correctly sparates different classes while maximizing the margin between them.

### Basic Princeples

1. Linearly Seperatable Case
For linearly seperatble data,SVM finds a hyperplane
